###Using the K-Means for Cars App  
With this Shiny application, you can interact with the standard R K-Means clustering algorithm, watching it cluster data in real time. The algorithm is run on the Motor Trend Cars data base with all variables available on the x or y axis and the ability to choose the number of clusters desired.

You can run the application at https://mikedamour.shinyapps.io/ShinyProject.

###Interaction  
The MTcars App allows you to  

- Choose any one of the *R-builtin mtcars* dataset for your x-axis and your y-axis using slide-out menus.  
- Choose the number of clusters you would like to have fit on the scatterplot data via slider.  
- As you choose variables, you will see the data change immediately, the algorithm choosing the tightest clusters and marking their centers prominently.  
- Pressing the slider arrow will cause the chosen set of variables to be clustered using 1 through 9 clusters.

The app also provides an interesting visualization of the relationship of automobile performance to various car features.
