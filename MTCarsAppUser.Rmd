###K-Means Interactive  

With K-Means Interactive, a Shiny application, you can watch the standard R K-Means clustering algorithm operate in real time. The algorithm is run on the Motor Trend *mtcars* data base with all variables available for plotting and the ability to choose the number of clusters.

###Interacting with K-Means
The K-Means app lets you   

- Choose any of the R-builtin *mtcars* dataset for your X or Y Feature using pull-down menus.  
- Choose the number of clusters you would like to have fit on the scatterplot data via slider.  
- As you choose features and cluster numbers, the data will update immediately. K-means chooses the clusters and marks their centers prominently.  
- Press the slider arrow  to sequence through clustering selections 1 to 9.

The app also provides an interesting visualization of the relationship of automobile performance to various car features.
